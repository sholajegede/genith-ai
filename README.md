# Genith

**Genith** is an image and video generation app that leverages AI/ML technology to create content from text prompts. The app uses **Pinata** for secure, decentralized storage of all generated media, ensuring users can easily store and fetch their creations.

This project was built using modern technologies, including **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Clerk** for authentication, **Convex.dev** as the database, and hosted with **Vercel** for seamless deployment.

## Getting Started

To run **Genith** locally, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** installed (v14 or higher).
- **npm** or **yarn** or **bun**  as the package manager.

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/genith-ai.git
cd genith-ai

```

Install dependencies:

```bash
bash
Copy code
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
bun install

```

### Running Locally

To start the development server:

```bash
bash
Copy code
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
bun run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) with your browser to see the app in action.


## Pinata Integration

**Genith** leverages **Pinata** for secure and decentralized media storage. All images and videos generated by users are stored on Pinata’s IPFS, making them easily retrievable and securely stored.

### Steps to Integrate Pinata

To integrate **Pinata** into your local environment:

1. Sign up for a **Pinata** account at [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud/).
2. Generate an **API Key** from your Pinata dashboard.
3. Add your **Pinata API Key** and **Pinata Secret Key** to the `.env.local` file.

```bash
bash
Copy code
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_API_KEY=your_pinata_api_key
PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY=your_pinata_secret_key

```

1. All media uploads will now be routed through Pinata for secure storage on the decentralized IPFS network.


## Environment Variables

To run **Genith**, you will need to set up environment variables. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following:

```bash
bash
Copy code
FAL_KEY=your_fal_ai_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_API_KEY=your_pinata_api_key
PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY=your_pinata_secret_key

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_clerk_webhook_key (to connect clerk auth with convex)

NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=your_convex_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_HTTP_URL=your_convex_http_url (for webhooks)

```

Replace the placeholders with the respective values for your **Pinata**, **Clerk**, and **Convex.dev** configurations.


## Running Locally

To run **Genith** locally for development purposes:

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies as mentioned in the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section.
2. Run the development server:

```bash
bash
